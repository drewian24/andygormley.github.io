    "text": "Notice that in these examples the artist utilizes only black and white colors with straight lines, yet when looking at the two lower examples the objects appear to be almost three dimensional. From the same website I also pulled examples where the artist used rules to develop markings, these markings could be a language unto itself, but in this case it is nothing more than generative art utilizing rules and parameters to create the objects, they are pasted below.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis next example comes from the website https://www.generativehut.com/post/generative-art-python-tutorial-for-penplotter and was created using Python. Similar to the first example I cited this work appears to be three dimensional. The author/artist of this work shared the code they used in Python to create this work.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy final examples of generative art come from the website https://blog.simondlr.com/posts/new-markets-in-the-arts-generative-art-economies , here the author utilizes color to create their art. The first example is below.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain this artwork has a three dimensional feel to it, what is interesting is that if you look closely at it you can see that the waves are created using lines. The example below (from the same artist and website) is an example utilizing colors and circles. It makes me think back to the days of looking into a cylindrical tube with colored beads as a child where I would see an array of kaleidoscopes by turning the tube with my hands.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy final example of generative art is a portrait that was created using this methodology. Again it comes from the same website as the two examples above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Fall R Script I utilized the color of RoyalBlue4. While not a fall color it makes me think of winter, when an ice storm will leave all the plants outside covered in ice. The output of that code is below. There is a certain beauty in nature when plants are covered in ice. The only changes in the code was to replace the brown color with my own. I utilized the R Color Cheat sheet by Melanie Frazier to find the color I desired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes I cannot help myself. Since I chose blue for winter I decided to edit the code a little more. The next plot shows what happens to plants when they are unable to hold up from the weight of the ice on them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe below chart was taken from Rueters (https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/EUROPE-GAS/zdvxozxzopx/). I find that this graphic is both unique and a bit confusing at the same time. I feel as though they could have used a better graphic to tell the story.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the graph is to show EU gas levels and how the EU is trying to stockpile gas to an 80% mark before the start of the winter season. A critical piece of information that I feel is being left out of this graphic is how much is 80% of the storage tanks? What is the total capacity of storage? The graphic makes it difficult to discern what the levels are at prior to 80 due to the nature of the graphic. While I applaud them for trying to show the data in a different manner or perspective, I find it difficult to clearly understand the numbers."

    "text": "The following images are from running the Murrel R Script.\nThis first image is a scatterplot, no colors are utilized and it is still clear and easy to understand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf all of the various graphics above, the perspective plot is my favorite. It is the lower left left which shows a three dimensional plot (it appears to be a circular mouth with a tongue coming out). My only issue with it would be utilizing it properly to show the data. Perspective plots done in a color gradient can be a powerful graphic when properly utilized."

    "text": "The first ask for this assignment was to compare the regression models and the various ways in which they could be plotted. First let’s look at the data for the model. As you can see below, the Anscombe data file contains 44 x variables and 44 y variables. The x variables are whole numbers while the y variables are decimal numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Anscombe has multiple models run within the R script, I will now look at the final four models. The four models are number numerically 1-4 and are simply linear models regressing the y to x variables (see below).\nlm1 <- lm(y1 ~ x1, data=anscombe)\nlm2 <- lm(y2 ~ x2, data=anscombe)\nlm3 <- lm(y3 ~ x3, data=anscombe)\nlm4 <- lm(y4 ~ x4, data=anscombe)\nThe included plots within the R script for the above models can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe four models have a simplistic yet effective layout. The text is done in Black, the regression line in Blue and the data points in Orange (with a red border). These contrasting colors enable the eye to quickly discern the data pattern and how it interacts with the regression line. Looking specifically at x3 and x4, the reader can see each linear model has an outlier data point. If the charts only featured a single color this would still be perceptible, but it would not come as easily with the color differentiation used above. The dots/circles used for data points is a common feature in charts such as this. One could change the shape to be a star, hexagon or other symbol, however, this can cause the chart to look overly dramatic and take away from the data being presented. However, if the user is looking to highlight outliers or a certain data point in each chart you could change a single data point (in this case the outlier) to be a star whereas the the data points are still a circle. This would aid in showcasing said outlier.\nThe next part of the assignment asks us to “finetune” the charts but without utilizing another software package. I first show the code that I changed and then the results. The first thing I did was change the data point color to red with a blue outline. I did this due to my preference of color, ease on the eyes and to create a larger contrast in color (especially for plot x4). Next I increased the size of the data points, this allow the user to see them easier. With the earlier change in color and outline x4 becomes more readable. Had I not changed to a greater contrast, the larger size in x4 would have caused the data points to look like a straight line. Next I changed the x and y axis to start at 2 versus 3, this moved the majority of the data closer to the center of the charts. Finally, I replaced the blue regression line with royal blue. I confess, it was super minor but I prefer the color. Below the code you can see my results.\nfor(i in 1:4) {\nff[2:3] <- lapply(paste0(c(“y”,“x”), i), as.name)\nplot(ff, data = anscombe, col = “blue”, pch = 21, bg = “red”, cex = 1.5,\nxlim = c(2, 19), ylim = c(2, 13))\nabline(mods[[i]], col = “royalblue”)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final ask of the assignment is to do the same exercise but with ggplot utilizing Tidyverse package. I should point out that the esteemed Dr. Brandt recently told me that friends don’t let friends Tidyverse.\nThe first plot shows the same four models from above in black and white.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above was created with the code below.\nlm1 <- ggplot(data = anscombe, mapping = aes(x = x1,y = y1))+\ngeom_point() + geom_line()\nlm2 <- ggplot(data = anscombe, mapping = aes(x = x2,y = y2))+\ngeom_point() + geom_line()\nlm3 <- ggplot(data = anscombe, mapping = aes(x = x3,y = y3))+\ngeom_point() + geom_line()\nlm4 <- ggplot(data = anscombe, mapping = aes(x = x4,y = y4))+\ngeom_point() + geom_line()\nlm1 / lm2 / lm3 /lm4\nNow let’s add some color to it. Looking at the code below I simply re-created the same four plots using the ggplot function within the Tidyverse package. I created the points to again be red (without the outline) and the line to be Blue. One difference here is that I did not use a trend line but instead a connecting line between the points on the axis. The outputs are below.\nggplot(data = anscombe, mapping = aes(x1, y1))+\ngeom_point(color=“red”) + geom_line(color=“blue”)\nggplot(data = anscombe, mapping = aes(x2, y2))+\ngeom_point(color=“red”) + geom_line(color=“blue”)\nggplot(data = anscombe, mapping = aes(x3, y3))+\ngeom_point(color=“red”) + geom_line(color=“blue”)\nggplot(data = anscombe, mapping = aes(x4, y4))+\ngeom_point(color=“red”) + geom_line(color=“blue”)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will notice that the connecting line works fine for the first three plots, however, for the final plot is does not work."
